               <h2>Biography</h2>
               <p>MS Dhoni was born on June 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand. His father, Narendra Singh and mother, Rajani, were the ones who gave him the name Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

                His family belongs to a cricketing background. His father was a wicketkeeper for the Bihar state team for several seasons and his grandfather Nand Kishore Singh played first-class cricket for Bihar and East Zone.
                
                </p>
                <p>He was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), on July 7, 1981. His mother, Devaki Devi, works from home, while his father, Pan Singh, was a junior manager at MECON, a Ministry of Steel PSU.

                    He attended school in Shyamali, near Ranchi, Jharkhand. He was an exemplary student-athlete, but he preferred badminton and football. He was his school’s goalkeeper.
                    
                    From 1995 to 1998, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to be a wicketkeeper. This was an accident. He was the Commando cricket club’s regular wicketkeeper during that period.
                    
                    From 1997–98, he made the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship team. After 10th grade, he took cricket seriously.</p>
                    <p>While playing for the Chennai Super Kings, Dhoni was a vital team member that won two back-to-back Indian Premier League championships in 2010 and 2011. He was also named the captain of the IPL franchise through the 2012 and 2013 seasons. He was the first Indian to be signed by an international Twenty20 franchise during the first season of the IPL when he joined Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting’s team, the Deccan Chargers.

                        Ms Dhoni was the first player in the history of the Indian Premier League to score 500 runs and take 100 wickets. He has received many awards for outstanding performances, including one of Wisden’s five Cricketers of the Year in 2010.</p>
                        <p>His achievements with the bat and glove have earned him several awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award twice (2008 & 2009), the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) twice (2008 & 2009), the Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World award twice (2009 & 2013), and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award twice (2008 & 2013).</p>
